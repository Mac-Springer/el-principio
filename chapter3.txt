Don't let your past define the choices we make in the present
For these are the moments
That define our future
Now, take a look around you
Brothers and sisters in arms
Look how far we've come
Own the moment, embrace your individuality
Head high, head first
Don't be afraid to dig deeper
Don't be afraid of what you find
Learn to love the darkness
So we can see ourselves in the light
So when you question the times
Always remember
We will rise again
